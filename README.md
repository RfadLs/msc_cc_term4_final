Project Title: Heart of the Abyss

Project description:

Dr. Voss awakens in an alien, mysterious place with no memory of her past. Strange surroundings stretch endlessly before her, filled with eerie clues and cryptic remnants of a life she cannot recall. As she ventures deeper, uncovering fragments of her lost memories, the truth begins to take shapeâ€”one haunting step at a time.

Explore a beautifully unsettling world where every detail holds a piece of the puzzle. Engage with interactive environments, discover hidden memories, and face relentless foes in dynamic battles that demand both strategy and precision. In Heart of the Abyss, the story unfolds through your actions, blending environmental storytelling with seamless interaction mechanics to create a deeply immersive experience.

Unravel the mystery of Dr. Voss's past and confront the shadows within. Will you piece together her story, or will the abyss consume you?
